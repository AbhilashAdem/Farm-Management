 </h3>
         <p>
             Since we launched The Good Growth Plan, we’ve established a solid foundation for reporting on progress that relies on independent data collection and validation, assurance by 3rd party assurance providers, and endorsement through our implementing partners. We publish our data to be transparent, accountable, and engage with our stakeholders in a different, new kind of dialogue.
Each year, we‘ll report our progress on all six commitments and provide detailed data and definitions in accordance with the best data practices. In this way you can track and verify our dedication to doing business responsibly based on real evidence.
