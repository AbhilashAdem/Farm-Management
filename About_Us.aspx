            <p >
                We are a business that helps humanity face its toughest challenge: how to feed a rising population, sustainably. Our world class science and innovative crop solutions transform
                how crops are grown to enable millions of growers to make better use of available resources. At the heart of our contribution is The Good Growth Plan, our six commitments to 
                address critical challenges the world faces to achieve food security. 
                <br />
                Our business – and the world’s food security – depend on sustainable natural resources, healthy ecosystems and thriving rural communities. Which is why we cooperate with industry partners,
                 governments and NGOs to support the achievement of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
               
                Our Corporate Governance is aligned with international standards and practice and helps us achieve not only our business objectives,
                but also helps create value to society that is demonstrated by our strong environmental and social performance.

            <p >
             We provide products and solutions to help farmers achieve global food security for a growing population, sustainably. We work by looking at agriculture through the eyes of growers, and by applying world-class science to develop crop protection products and seeds.
             Our innovations help farmers to overcome multiple challenges – from weeds, insects and disease, to the effects of heat and cold on crops. Whether they grow corn or rice, 
             vegetables or coffee, farmers around the world trust Syngenta to help them produce healthy, premium crops and minimize the use of precious natural resources.

            <h3 style="color:#406753">How we do it!</h3>
            <p >
             At the heart of our business are innovation, ethical operations and a collaborative mindset. 

Our research and development leads the agricultural industry: we spend US$1.4bn a year on R&D and regularly bring new products to market, even though this can take up to 13 years. 

Our Corporate Responsibility performance – in areas including environment, labor practices, and human rights – adheres to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which helps businesses communicate their impact on sustainability issues. 

Collaboration is essential to our innovation. We work in partnership with academia, NGOs and other agricultural businesses, and we encourage innovators to reach out to us through our thoughtseeders® platform.
